The Definitions

Mode - Most repeated value in a distribution. If there is a tie between 2 values in terms of the count, then the distribution is said to be bimodal. Mutlimodal distributions have > 2 values which have a tie (or approximate) tie in terms of count.
The concept of mode is used in determinining sizes - shirts, shoes etc.

Median - Middle value when the elements are sorted. If there are even number of elements, median is the average of the 2 middle numbers
To find the median
- Sort the numbers
- Median term = (n + 1) / 2 th term
Median is unaffected by the magnitude of the extreme values


Mean - average of all the numbers
Population mean and sample mean µ = ∑x / N
Mean is affected by the magnitude of the extreme values = ∑x/n

Percentile - A measure of central tendency that divides a group of data into 100 parts. There are 99 percentiles.
nth percentile is the value such that at least n% of the data are below that value and (100-n)% are above that value
To find median
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- Pth percentile of a set of n numbers is at location i. i = P * n / 100
- If i is a whole number, Pth percentile value = (Value at location i + Value at location i + 1) /2
- If i is not a whole number, Pth percentile value = Value at location (integer part of i + 1)

50th percentile is the median
